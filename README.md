# BUAN/MECO 6312 - Applied Econometrics and Time Series Analysis

# Instructor: Quanquan Liu

## Course description

The objective of this course is to provide a thorough introduction to the theory and application of contemporary econometric tools. Specifically, it teaches students to empirically estimate and interpret commonly used econometric techniques to analyze cross-sectional, time series and panel data sets. Emphasis will be placed on the following:
* Understanding theory through applications and problem solving rather than complex proofs
* Working as a learning community to improve statistical and econometric skills necessary in the study of business and economics
Throughout this course you will hone your understanding of linear and non-linear regression as well as other forms of economic regression with different variables. After the successful completion of BUAN/MECO 6312, a typical student should be able to:
* Derive statistical parameters to estimate causal relationships
* Estimate statistical parameters of a regression analysis using the Stata software package
* Interpret results of regression analysis with different specifications
* Conduct empirical economic research using the knowledge and techniques of econometric models you have learned in this class

## Repository objectives

* Syncing code between team-members 
* Logging homeworks and course work
